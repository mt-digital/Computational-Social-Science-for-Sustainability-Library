# socmod: Curated Social Science Models in R
#### (pronounce _soash-mod_)

Create computer programs to help design intervention strategies for sustainability,
global health, and other critical social problems. 

## Purpose

It is increasingly recognized that social dynamics greatly affect the success of
interventions for improved sustainability, pandemic preparedness and public
health, and other pressing challenges. This `socmod` library is designed to
provide tools for social scientists to design computer programs that simulate
large-scale social experiments in idealized settings. This code is a curated selection
of social science models that can be used to simulate idealized social
interactions structured by social connections. Social interactions considered
here include learning from others, opinion influence, and economic cooperation.
Social connections are represented by social networks.

## Quickstart example

For example, one could
